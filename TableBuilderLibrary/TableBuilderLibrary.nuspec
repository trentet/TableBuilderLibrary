    <description>This is an open-source class library with an aim to conveniently offer a variety of methods for creating and modifying DataTables. Note: Most exception handling is still under development. </description>
    <releaseNotes>Corrected handling of tables that already contain a column that should be used as a Guid instead of creating a new one. Switched to a Regex solution for splitting CSV. This allows for correct parsing of CSV files with cells that are quoted and contain commas.</releaseNotes>
